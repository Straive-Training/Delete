class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_holder, balance=0):
        self.account_holder = account_holder
        self.__balance = balance   # Private attribute (encapsulation)

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds!")

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Usage
account = BankAccount("Alice", 1000)
account.deposit(500)
account.withdraw(200)
print(account.get_balance())  # 1500
