“What are the key definitions introduced in this document?”
“List all the sections or headings in this PDF.”
“What examples does the PDF give for the X concept?”
Learning Outcome:

Practical Applications
Ask the chatbot to generate tasks or exercises based on the PDF:
“Create 5 MCQs from this chapter.”
“Write a coding problem inspired by this text.”
“Make a real-world example that uses the concepts in this PDF.”
Learning Outcome:
